        <p>Juwai hosts events for property buyers to learn about the overseas property market, but due to a lack of promotion, the attendance rate was poor. In order to remedy the situation, we created a brand-new event channel on Juwai.com, which will serve as a hub for promoting and organizing events.
            Additionally, we developed a content management system (CMS) to facilitate team management of the channel.</p>

                    On the top of the event channel homepage, a rotating banner was implemented to showcase featured and upcoming events, aiming to increase the exposure and participation rate.

                <p>Based on our study of current landing pages, we have developed a responsive landing page template incorporating the sections we identified.</p>

The well-organized page enables visitors to navigate and access comprehensive event details, ultimately leading to increased participation rates.

                <p>
In order to streamline the event management process, we have developed a CMS for marketing team to independently manage both the event channel and the event landing pages.
                </p>
                <p>The event landing page template is divided into sections, each designed as modules with pre-defined layouts. The team can easily modify the text and upload images using the input fields within the CMS.</p>
            <p>
Once the landing page is published through the CMS, it will automatically generate and appear on the Event Channel, ensuring a seamless and efficient process for displaying event information.</p>
