        <p>Juwai.com, originally designed to cater to Chinese buyers interested in overseas properties, where homepage had too much real estate news, making it look like a news site that might confuse our users. To fix this issue, this project aims to redesign the homepage to better reflect Juwai's main goal as a property search platform and to meet the needs of our buyers more effectively.</p>
