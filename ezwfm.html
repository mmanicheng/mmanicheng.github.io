                <h2>Focus Group Workshop</h2>

                <p>
                    At the start of the project, we organized weekly focus group workshops with the app users, sspecially the client's staff who follow a set roster. Our main objective was to understand the challenges they face when it comes to tasks such as checking their roster, applying for leave, and other related activities.</p>
                <img src="img/ezwfm/01.webp">
                <p>
                    During these workshops, we utilized sticky notes and a whiteboard to gather and consolidate data from the focus group. We have learned that every time a new roster is prepared, HR prints a few hard copies and displays them in the office for staff to review. If staff wish to swap shifts or request leave, they must obtain approval from their supervisor. Upon receiving approval, they make manual changes to the printed roster, resulting in a messy document. HR is then required to collect these copies to calculate payroll each month. This is painful to everyone involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar problem also happened for clock in/out process. If a staff's clock in/out time doesn't align with the scheduled roster, they are required to fill out a paper form explaining the discrepancy and submit it to their supervisor and HR. Failure to do so may impact their payroll.
